## What we've done

We refactored our Java Servlets to be REST endpoints using JAX-RS.

We implemented the REST endpoints for user authentication, authors, publications, topics, users, 
and author requests. 

We have also implemented all the relevant services and repositories for 
these classes.

## WIP
* document our code
* implement the ui/ux
